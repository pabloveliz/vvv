# Virtual Volumes View

VVV is an application that catalogs the content of removable volumes like CD and DVD disks for off-line searching.

Folders and files can also be arranged in a single, virtual file system.

Each folder of this virtual file system can contain files from many disks so you can arrange your data in a simple and logical way.

VVV also stores metadata information from audio files: author, title, album and so on. Most audio formats are supported.

It is possible to share the same catalog, stored in a [network server](docs/SERVER.md), among Windows, Linux and OSX computers. The network server is simply a computer running a database server program.

VVV can show the content of your disks in three different views:

- **physical**: shows the content of each disk, you can navigate in the folders structure and see the files contained in each folder.
- **virtual**: everything is organized as a single virtual file system. You can create folders and you can assign physical volumes or folders to each virtual folder. You can assign the same file to more than one virtual folder, and each virtual folder can contain files that are stored in different disks.
- **search**: you can search the catalog looking for files that meet your specification.
