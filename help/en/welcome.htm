<H2>Welcome to VVV</H2>
Welcome to VVV. VVV is an application that catalogs the content of removable volumes like CD and DVD disks for off-line searching. Folders and files can also be arranged in a single, virtual file system. Each folder of this virtual file system can contain files from many disks so you can arrange your data in a simple and logical way.<P>

VVV also stores metadata information from audio files: author, title, album and so on.<P>

VVV is available for the <B>Windows</B>, <B>Linux</B> and <B>OS X</B> operating systems. You can exchange catalogs between Windows, Linux and
OS X computers, and you can share the same catalog, stored in a network server, among Windows, Linux and
OS X computers.</FONT></BODY></HTML>
