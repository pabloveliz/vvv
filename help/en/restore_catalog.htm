<H2>Restore catalog</H2>
Use this window to restore a catalog from an existing backup file.<P>

You must enter the path of the backup file and the path of the catalog to be created. You will not be able to type the name of an existing file as the catalog name: you must type the name of a non-existing file.<P>

Press OK to create the new catalog: this task might take some time, and the program will tell you when it will be finished.  The program will not open the restored catalog: you will have to do it by yourself.<P>
