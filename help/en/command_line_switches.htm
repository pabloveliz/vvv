<H2>Command line switches</H2>
Note: these information are for advanced users. You need them to use VVV in particular ways but are usually not needed by most users.<P>

It is possible to pass the name of a catalog file to the command line. For example:<P>
vvv "C:My CatalogsMy Catalog.vvv"<P>

VVV can be invoked from the command line using switches and options that make it possible to use VVV as a portable application or to update a volume in batch mode, without user input. Option values can be specified in three ways:
<UL><LI>vvv -s "option value"
<LI>vvv -s:"option value"
<LI>vvv -s"option value"</UL>

<h3>VVV as a portable application</h3>

It is possible to run VVV as a portable application, for example from an USB memory stick without installing it in the computer and without leaving any trace in the computer. The options to use the program as a portable application are the following:<P>

<B>-s &lt;file name&gt;</B><P>

specifies the name of a file used to store the program's settings. Note that it is a full file name, not a path to a folder. The file name can be relative to the  program's executable location or it can be absolute.<BR>
Without this option the settings would be stored in the computer, using the Registry under Windows and files under other operating systems. With this option settings are always stored in a file, and you can store that file in the USB stick.<P>

So for example you can use one of the following command lines:<P>

<UL><LI>vvv -s "..\DataSettings\VVV Settings File.txt"
<LI>vvv -s:"..\DataSettings\VVV Settings File.txt"
<LI>vvv -s"..\DataSettings\VVV Settings File.txt"</UL><P>

<B>-d &lt;folder name&gt;</B><P>

specifies the default folder when creating a new catalog. If relative it is relative to the  program's executable location. Without this option the default would be the <B>Documents</B> folder of the user, which has no use for a portable application.

<h3>How to batch-update a volume</h3>

These options are used to run the program from the command line instead of running it as a GUI application. They can be used to update volumes from the command line.<P>

<B>-v &lt;volume name&gt;</B><P>

specifies a volume name to be processed. &lt;volume name&gt; is a string.<P>
   
<B>-vp &lt;volume path&gt;</B><P>

specifies the path of the volume to be processed in the file system. If relative it is relative to the  program's executable location.<P>
   
<B>-u</B><P>

update the volume. This switch causes VVV to run in command line mode instead of showing a GUI.<BR>
When using this switch you always need to pass a catalog name and a volume path in the command line.<BR>
The program will not reopen the last used catalog, since it might change.<P>
   
So to update a volume in batch mode you must use all the three switches above and supply a catalog name. For example:<P>

vvv -u -v:"Ever changing volume" -vp:"D:\" "C:CatalogsMyCatalog.vvv"
