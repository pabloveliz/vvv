a class that stores and resets the original position of a window

the position is stored using a config object
uses the wxWindow ID to identify each window

USAGE:

in the window's header file

	include the header:

		#include "window_position.h"

	add a private member:

		CWindowPosition m_WindowPosition;

in the cpp file

	at the end of Create() add:

		m_WindowPosition.SetWindow( this );
		m_WindowPosition.RestorePosition();

	in the destructor add:

		m_WindowPosition.SavePosition();
